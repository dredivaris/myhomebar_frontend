# GTK:
Shortcut for `apollo client:codegen --endpoint http://localhost:5000/graphql --target typescript types` is cdg - for now not working

Use `docker ps` to get container ids and `docker attach <container id>` to attach to it.


# Running:
docker-compose up

npm start

# TODOs
cdg shortcut doesnt work while its constituents do.. figure out why
